function maxFO = getMaxFractionalOccupancy(Gamma,T,options)
% Finds the maximum fractional occupancy for each subject/trial.
% This is a useful statistic to diagnose whether the HMM solution is
% "mixing well" or states are assigned to describe entire subjects (in
% which case the HMM is doing a poor job in finding the data dynamics)
